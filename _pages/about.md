Hi! My name is Sarah and I'm a recent computer science graduate from Texas A&M University.
Before attending A&M, I had the amazing opportunity to be enrolled in an early college program
at my high school, allowing me to obtain my Associates degree in Mathematics the same year as my GED.
Now that I've graduated from A&M, I'm looking for a full-time position where i can extend my knowledge 
even further and gain some real-world experience. I also want to eventually persue a Masters degree, most 
likely also in computer science, but only time will tell.

The main idea of this website is to be a collectioin of a few of my projects, it's definitely more of a dynamic site 
and will be updated with more projects as I complete them, so come back often to see what's new! I'm also quite a fan
of traveling, so each page has a header image of a picture I took while abroad. With all that being said, thank you for 
visiting my website, I hope you found it worthwhile. :)
