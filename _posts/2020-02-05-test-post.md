# H1 Heading

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

This is just normal text.

Now some *italics*

Let's make it **bold** text.

Here's a link [link](http://github.com)

Here's a list of things I love:
* My gf
+ Alicia
- My baby

Here's the list numbered:
1. My gf
+ Alicia 
- My baby

Here's a code block (Python):
```python
	import numpy as np
	
	def test_function(x,y):
	  z = np.sum(x,y)
	  return z
```

For inline code it looks like `x+y`.

For some math stuff:
$$z=x+y$$
